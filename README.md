Society Security Solution System:
The Society Security Solution System is a comprehensive database management system designed to manage information about residents and visitors within a residential complex. This system caters to three distinct user roles: Administrator, Supervisor, and Flat Residents. Each user role has specific privileges, allowing access only to authorized data.

The system provides a simple user interface for Administrator, Supervisor, and Flat Residents.

Login credentials determine the user's role as Administrator, Supervisor, or Flat Resident.

Functionalities by User Roles:
Administrator:

Uploads and maintains database tables related to visitor details and staff details.

Visitor Management:
Visitor details are categorized into two sections: Normal visitors and regular visitors & vendors.
For normal visitors, details including visitor information and flat number are recorded. Flat residents receive push notifications for pending request approval.
Flat residents approve visitor entries, which are then reflected in the visitor table as "approved".
Regular visitors and vendors are assigned security codes for check-in/check-out processes, with their details and timing recorded.
Maintenance Management:
Maintenance details table records maintenance amounts for each flat, indicating whether payments are due and the date and mode of payment.
Staff Management:
Staff details table includes information about security personnel, cleaning staff, gardeners, temple staff, clubhouse staff, etc.
Initial Access:
The system starts with a login form on the first page, requiring username and password. These credentials determine user authentication and authorization
